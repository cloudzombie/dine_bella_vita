						<h3>Private Dining</h3>
						<p>Our private dining accommodations at Bella Vita consist of four separate private dining rooms. They are distinctly appointed with Angelic &amp; Lion Head flowing fountains &amp; Italian hand-painted mosaic tile tables. We also boast an exclusive Italian-style courtyard, dubbed the "Corta Bella" with wood beamed ceilings &amp; artistic treasures that would make Michelangelo smile! Our private brick vaulted Wine Room can accommodate up to 25 guests, The 3 indoor spaces, Fontina Room(40 ppl), Corta Bella A-(12 ppl)&amp; Corta Bella B-(28 ppl), can accommodate up to 80 guests collectively, or can subdivide into many different sized configurations, for private or semi-private events as well. Together, these combined spaces, in addition to the front area of the restaurant, can be utilized to seat up to about 250 guests for a complete buyout of the restaurant. Enveloped in a sumptuous Florentine-style setting, our unique private dining accommodations at Bella Vita take in the beauty of the restaurant, while at the same time allowing for privacy, without the confinement of a simple four-walled banquet room. A remarkable &amp; spectacular environment in which to hold your next upcoming private event. </p>

<p>We look forward to serving you at Bella Vita sometime soon! </p>

<p>Additional Information</p>

<p>While we do not have a room charge for our private spaces, we do require a food &amp; beverage minimum. Room minimums are based on seasonal demand as well as the date and time of the event and we reserve the right to change room venues if the group size changes. These minimum expenditures represent the required food &amp; beverage to be met, excluding tax and service charges. * An 8.25% sales tax &amp; a 20% service/gratuity charge will be added to all private events. Restaurant buyouts are also available at an additional fee. To confirm all reservations, a 30% non-refundable deposit is required on all private dining events. Acceptance of these policies shall be acknowledged in full, once a valid credit card has been received in order to guarantee and confirm a specific event.<br />
<strong>An expected attendance must be received no later than 72 working hours prior to the scheduled event.</strong> This will be considered the guaranteed attendance and will not be subject to reduction. Otherwise, the expected number of guests listed on the private dining room contract will be what is understood as the guaranteed number of guests. For groups of 15 or more, all wine &amp; private dining menu orders must be received by the restaurant no less than 1 week prior to the event. <br />
This is essential for preparing the menu and in providing certain wine selections. Specific vintages may vary based on availability. A fifty (50%) cancellation fee of the total estimated cost will be in effect for all functions cancelled within 2 weeks of an event. (Holiday cancellation policies are different). A $50 cancellation fee will be assessed on all cancelled events without exception. </p>-->
