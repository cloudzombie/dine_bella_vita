            <h3>Private Dining</h3>
            <p>Our private dining accommodations at Bella Vita consist of four separate private dining rooms. They are distinctly appointed with Angelic &amp; Lion Head flowing fountains &amp; Italian hand-painted mosaic tile tables. We also boast an exclusive Italian-style courtyard, dubbed the "Corta Bella" with wood beamed ceilings &amp; artistic treasures that would make Michelangelo smile! Our private brick vaulted Wine Room can accommodate up to 25 guests, The 3 indoor spaces, Fontina Room(40 ppl), Corta Bella A-(12 ppl)&amp; Corta Bella B-(28 ppl), can accommodate up to 80 guests collectively, or can subdivide into many different sized configurations, for private or semi-private events as well. Together, these combined spaces, in addition to the front area of the restaurant, can be utilized to seat up to about 250 guests for a complete buyout of the restaurant. Enveloped in a sumptuous Florentine-style setting, our unique private dining accommodations at Bella Vita take in the beauty of the restaurant, while at the same time allowing for privacy, without the confinement of a simple four-walled banquet room. A remarkable &amp; spectacular environment in which to hold your next upcoming private event. </p>
            <p>We look forward to serving you at Bella Vita sometime soon! </p>
            <p><strong>Plan your next event with Bella Vita Ristorante!</strong></p>
