            <h3>Jan - manager</h3>
            <p>Jan, a Los Altos resident, spent the better part of his youth traveling the world and experiencing different cultures and their food.

            <h3>Shamus - chef</h3>
            <p>Presentation and pallet are two peas in a pod in Shamus's kitchen. "The absence of either is only half the experience, and experience does not exist in halves," he states eloquently in his broken English. For Shamus, eating is an experience even when it is a grilled-cheese sandwich. Of course, when it is prepared by Shamus, even a simple grilled-cheese sandwich is anything but a simple experience and an explosive delight. Starting his career in a butchers shop before adolescence, at an early age Shamus developed a fascination and a discerning eye for quality in food. Over the years, cooking became a natural extension of this passion, igniting his career as a renowned chef in the Bay Area.</p>

            <h3>Miguel - chef</h3>
            <p>“The connection between a creative thought in my mind and the ability to develop the concept into a finished product using my hands has always attracted me,” says Miguel. “Cooking became a natural extension of this passion, igniting my career.” Growing up in a food-focused household, where formal, white tablecloth dinners were a bi-weekly event, Miguel learned early on that a meal was an experience with a soul, bringing people together to share their lives. He began his career at the age of 16 working his way through several restaurants, developing skills for a career that he claims, “chose me as much as I chose it.”</p>
